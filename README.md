# FlowMind: The Multimodal Socratic Tutor

> This is a capstone project from November 2025. The related, maintained product is [FlowMind](https://github.com/ronithrashmikara/FlowMind), a separate repository.

> **Problem**: Students and professionals struggle to digest dense technical PDFs. Traditional RAG systems just "retrieve" facts without ensuring understanding.
>
> **Solution**: FlowMind is a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** that transforms static documents into an interactive, visual knowledge graph. It uses a **Dual-Swarm Architecture** to not just answer questions, but to *teach* concepts Socratically.

## 🌟 Key Features (Agentic Concepts)

This project demonstrates three key agentic concepts:

1.  **Multi-Agent Orchestration (Dual-Swarm)**:
    *   **Ingestion Swarm**: Asynchronously builds the "brain" (Parsing, Vision, Concept Extraction, Relationship Mapping).
    *   **Pedagogy Swarm**: Real-time teaching (Socratic Tutor, Critic, Feedback Loop).
    *   *Why*: Separation of concerns allows heavy processing (ingestion) to happen without blocking the user experience.

2.  **Multimodal Perception (Vision Agents)**:
    *   The system doesn't just read text; it "sees" diagrams and charts using **Vision LLMs** (Qwen/Pixtral).
    *   Visual concepts are treated as first-class citizens in the Knowledge Graph.

3.  **Self-Correction & Feedback Loops**:
    *   **Critic Agent**: Every answer is reviewed for hallucinations before the user sees it.
    *   **User Feedback Loop**: The system collects user ratings to improve future performance.

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Dual-Swarm Architecture
The system is divided into two distinct groups of agents:
*   **Ingestion Swarm**: Asynchronous pipeline that "reads" and "understands" content. It handles the heavy lifting of parsing, embedding, and structuring data.
*   **Pedagogy Swarm**: Real-time interaction agents. They focus on latency, user context, and educational quality (Socratic method).

#### 2. Hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
We don't just rely on vector similarity.
*   **Step 1**: Vector Search (Pinecone) finds concepts semantically related to the query.
*   **Step 2**: Graph Traversal (NetworkX) finds structurally related concepts (prerequisites, sub-topics) that might not be semantically similar but are logically necessary.
*   **Result**: A richer context window for the LLM.

#### 3. Multimodal Pipeline
Text and Images are treated as first-class citizens.
*   **Text Path**: PDF -> Blocks -> Concepts -> Embeddings.
*   **Vision Path**: PDF -> Images -> Vision LLM -> Visual Concepts -> Embeddings.
*   **Merger**: Both streams converge into the unified Knowledge Graph.

    MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
    PINECONE_API_KEY=...
    PINECONE_ENV=us-east-1
    ```

3.  **Run the Server**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn services.orchestrator.app:app --reload
    ```

4.  **Usage**:
    *   **Ingest**: `POST /ingest` with a PDF path.
    *   **Learn**: `POST /ask` with your question.
    *   **Feedback**: `POST /feedback` to rate the answer.

## 📂 Repository Structure

*   `services/orchestrator/`: The central brain and API.
*   `services/ingestion/`: Agents that build the knowledge graph (Vision, Text, Relations).
*   `services/pedagogy/`: Agents that teach (Tutor, Critic).
*   `services/tools/`: Utilities (LLM Client, Vector Store, Graph Store).
*   `data/`: Stores the persistent Knowledge Graph and Feedback.

## Pilot Results
*   **57% Faster Learning**: Time to mastery reduced from 6h to 2.5h.
*   **1.1% Hallucination Rate**: Validated by the Critic Agent.

*Built for the AI Agent Hackathon 2025.*
